SocketDevice.h

September 2018

This is meant to be a layer to abstract away the actual socket calls. In any cross-platform extentions, this would be an interface 
that would be implemented by different platform-specific classes (Unix, Windows, etc).
For this project, we don't bother with an interface and instead just add some basic unix socket functionalit.
